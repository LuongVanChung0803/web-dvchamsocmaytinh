Listening.
Can you tell us about a memorable night, Helen?
Well, let me see.
There are quite a lot of them, actually.
But yes, there was one particular night this year that was memorable.
When was it?
It was the 14th of February.
Valentine's Day?
Yes, that's why I remember the date.
It was Valentine's Day, but I didn't have a boyfriend at the time.
In fact, I was with two friends.
Where were you?
I was in Manchester.
There was a concert that night by my favourite band, Vampire Weekend.
So, I travelled to Manchester to see it.
When did you arrive in Manchester?
The night before the concert.
So, what did you do before the concert?
We had a drink in a very old pub in the city centre.
Then we tried to find the concert.
We didn't know exactly where the club was, so we walked around for a very long time.
In the end, we got there five minutes before the concert started.
Was the concert good?
Yes, it was fantastic.
The band played all our favourite songs, and we danced and sang for about two hours.
Did you go home after the concert?
No, we didn't go home straight away.
We didn't have dinner before it started, so we were hungry.
We went to Manchester's curry mile, and we had a curry.
It was delicious.
After that, we got a taxi home.
What time did you get home?
We didn't get home that late.
It was two o'clock in the morning, more or less, but we had a great time.
That was the important thing.
